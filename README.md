Note : This is coded via an older version on OpenGL.

This program uses OpenGL API to implement its functionalities.

I was messing around with Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm for line drawing and came up with this program.

Once an initial point and an end point is marked with the left-click in the mouse, a line will be drawn between those two points. 
The next point marked will be connected with a new line with the previous end point.
To reset and draw a new line or a new drawing on the current drawing simply right click on the screen and continue.
If you want to reset and clear the current drawing, press 'e'/ 'E' and continue on with the new drawing,
